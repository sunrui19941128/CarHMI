  title: Automotive HMI Template
  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: This template contains a simple, interactive automotive HMI, spanning an
      instrument cluster, a head unit and a HVAC/climate control screen. Each screen
      has its own scene, but some assets (like themes) are shared across the screens.
      The car's HMI controls can be emulated using configurable keymaps.

    text: "This work was inspired by the exterior car design of Tianze Yu and the
      interior car design of Lukas Chesla which is part of a larger sponsorship with
      the College for Creative Studies (CCS) in Detroit, Michigan. To learn more
      about Unity\u2019s collaboration with CCS, see our blog post on it"
